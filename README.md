Playing with prime numbers

I consistently find my thoughts pulled back to prime numbers. Sooner or
later, I think of something else to look at pertaining to prime numbers. 

This repository will hold some of the investigations, inquisitions, and
playful explorations I partake in with this intriguing set of numbers.

### [PrimeFinder](https://github.com/Mintzmyer/OptimizePrimes/blob/master/PrimeFinder/README.md)
This folder holds a way to find primes! But, not particularly well or 
anything. Equivalent bash and powershell scripts bruteforce and auto
commit their findings

### [PrimeOrganizer](https://github.com/Mintzmyer/OptimizePrimes/blob/master/PrimeOrganizer/README.md)
This folder holds a way to format and visualize prime numbers. It writes
a file of the first 10,000 primes separated into 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's
columns. This can then be exported to a spreadsheet program and printed
as a tasteful and thought-provoking wall decoration

### [PrimeVisualizer](https://github.com/Mintzmyer/OptimizePrimes/blob/master/PrimeVisualizer/README.md)
This folder holds some art generated with the (python) OpenGL library
using prime numbers. 

### [Visualizer](https://github.com/Mintzmyer/OptimizePrimes/blob/master/Visualizer/README.md)
Not prime number related, but this folder holds some additional art
generated with the OpenGL library that's similarly nerdy
