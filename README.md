Playing with prime numbers

I consistently find my thoughts pulled back to prime numbers. Sooner or
later, I think of something else to look at pertaining to prime numbers. 

This repository will hold some of the investigations, inquisitions, and
playful explorations I partake in with this intriguing set of numbers.

### PrimeOrganizer
This folder holds a way to format and visualize prime numbers. It writes
a file of the first 10,000 primes separated into 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's
columns. This can then be exported to a spreadsheet program and printed
as a tasteful and thought-provoking wall decoration
