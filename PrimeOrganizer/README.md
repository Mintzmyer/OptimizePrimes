# PrimeOrganizer
This project helps visualize a sequence of prime numbers by
distributing them into like columns by their smallest digit. 

For Example:

| 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 |   |
|11 | 13 |  | 17 | 19|
|   | 23 |  |   | 29 |
|31 |    |  | 37 |   |
|41 | 43 |  | 47 |   |

...etc

It was largely written as an exercise to familiarize myself
with Windows PowerShell, and ironing out my workspace setup.

Plus, now I have a really excellent cubicle decoration.
