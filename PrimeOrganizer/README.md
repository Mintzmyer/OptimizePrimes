# PrimeOrganizer
This project helps visualize a sequence of prime numbers by
distributing them into like columns by their smallest digit. 

For Example:

| 1 | 3 | 7 | 9 |
| - | - | - | - |
|11 | 13 | 17 | 19|
|   | 23 |    | 29 |
|31 |    | 37 |    |

...etc

It was largely written as an exercise to familiarize myself
with Windows PowerShell, and ironing out my workspace setup.

Plus, now I have a really excellent cubicle decoration.
